# Breast-Cancer-Detection-via-CNN-Model
The CNN model is designed with a stack of three convolutional layers and two fully connected layers. Each convolutional layer strategically employs max-pooling and batch normalization, enhancing the network's ability to discern hierarchical features in breast ultrasound images. This architecture is purpose-built to classify these images into the categories of benign or malignant. The normal class has been excluded from the model, as the image composition is vastly different from the other classes, causing the convolution errors in running. The utilization of binary crossentropy loss and accuracy metrics during model compilation underscores its' suitability for multiclass image classification tasks. The comprehensive summary of the CNN model provides an overview of its structure and layer configurations, conveying the intricate architecture designed for optimal feature extraction and classification. Moreover, the hyperparameters, including the number of convolutional layers, kernel size, and max-pooling size, are explicitly specified, offering a detailed glimpse into the configurational aspects that contribute to the model's efficacy in medical image analysis.
